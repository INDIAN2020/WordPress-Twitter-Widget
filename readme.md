To use this widget, in the WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins -> Add New -> Upload, and choose the file that you downloaded here. Activate it.

Then, go to Appearance -> Widgets, and you'll now have a new Twitter widget to play around with. As long as your theme is setup to use widgets (like it should), you should be all set!

The widget caches tweets for 5 minutes at a time (unless you change the username).
